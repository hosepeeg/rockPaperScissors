# rockPaperScissors
Will be creating a simple game of rock paper scissors. As of now this game will be run completely within the console. However, I will return in future lessons to add a user interface with buttons, animations, and some "flare". The game will be played by the player, as well as a computer. We all should no the rules if not; rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, and scissor beats paper! 


**Update**
Added user interface, the game is 5 rounds and the scoreboard is updated based on the results of the round. The game plays 5 rounds before deciding the result ; win, lose, or draw. The background color of the circles change based on the result of the round; green, red, yellow. Lastly, the user and computer choice is displayed round to round so the player knows what the computer is choosing as well. Lastly, the end result is printed to the screen. If the user wishes to play games, a retart button is display after the results are displayed.
